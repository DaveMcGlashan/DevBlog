A Brief history:
After a uni degree in ComSci and a few years as a BA I left the tech industry to be a pilot, prpoerty investor and so on. I missed the complex Challengesand also needed something to make my brain use a different thought pattern inmy current loop, will anything come of this endevour? who cares.

01 May 2020:
Got sick of taking down time and the COVID-19 pandemic is a real ball buster need something to my my brain work

02 May 2020:
Always enjoy dusting off the prograing books and a Mashable special caught my attention.
Mashable Course was a fucking joke, can't get a refund FFS, what else can I use?
In the past(2017) I used The Odin Project which I enjoyed but i thought if I felt like stuff was too repetitive i'd loose interest, I'll go back to TOP but let's get my fundamentals dusted off on something new.
Codeacademy it is a few months will be cheaper than the money I lost to mashable.  I'll dick about and start tomorrow.
Went to humblebundle to DL some books I got ages ago will send them to the iPad

0930 Work first then a bit of code>
1800 day is finished headed to code Codeacademy
1830 Settled on the "Web Developer" Career path, if I go web I want to skew fullstack but mostly focus on functional frontend and great backend.
Calling it a day first module "Learn HTML" in the bag nice to refresh but nothing new here.

06 May 2020:
Long day I was doing CSS at 0015 so my streak is intact
ended upo clearing Colour and Typo in my evening

07 May 2020:
Small Code challenge easy then onto responseive, feels nice to learn, Codeacademyteaches well but the "don't drown approach of TOP is cool too."
responseiveness and Flex, why did I bother with the other CSS BS

08 May 2020:
Nice Friday, work was good. hitting Code Academy Early

2025 quick blog post - https://medium.com/p/d6db5cd76d61/edit
2045 Cleared my GitHub Repo of my old repos, still backed up but I like a clean space. Also added this DevBlog to Github.
2205 Spent about 90 minutes in here fleshed out a game idea wnet back to Codeacademy and it was time to wrap up Iterators.
2305 Done, I was overthing shit...
Objects is next I think I'll hit this and leave a lesson & project for tomorrow, Then that leaves "Building Interactive JavaScript Websites" for next week so I expect some DOM is in my future. but for now tomorrow is
2320 objects are great I have two major annoyances at this time Codeacademy doesn't use an IDE, with with some screwed up variable names really sucks and causes tons of errors. Also I speak british english and Colour is not how you fucking spell it!
0017 Didn't finish Objects, bunch of practicals tomorrow, bed now.
